### Why this exists
*Clinicians are overloaded with data but starved for insights. There is great potential for machine learning to help - but only if their outputs are **clear, actionable, trustworthy, and integrated into existing workflows.**

Clinicians shouldn't need to understand SHAP values - they need actionable insights. This dashboard demonstrates how insights from rigorously trained and interpreted ML models can integrate into clinical workflows, translating raw predictions into simple, actionable insights with trust-building visualizations.

### Hypothetical Impact
This demo illustrates how ML models can be adapted for
- **Time saving**: In a simulated patient cohort, this dashboard reduced the time-to-insight from raw values by over 90% compared to manual data review by an expert.

- **Adoption potential**: Designed with iterative clinician feedback to prioritize interpretability and useability.

- **Hypothetically reduce cognitive load** by automating routine assessments.
